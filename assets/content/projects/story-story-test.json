Every chance we have had to try to stop the reproduction of digital information, we have failed. Digital Rights Management has been a problem ever since the internet was created.\n\nThe zero marginal cost associated with reproducing digital information has created a situation where all of our information is free. Digital art cannot be scarce because information, to be distributed in a computer network needs to be replicated. If I upload an image to Facebook, I own the image. When you go to my profile to see that image, you download the blueprint for your browser to reproduce that image locally. This is how we 'send' stuff online. We don't send the stuff, we send the instructions for your computer to replicate the stuff. \n\nWhile the zero marginal cost of replicating online information is incredibly liberating in many ways, it also puts a limit in the amount of value that digital property can acquire. We don't put a monetary value on wind or sun, because for all intents and purposes, there is an unlimited supply. Complete abundance is incredible for some things, but property rights require scarcity. \n\nBefore NFTs were created, all digital property had no value. If it carried some value, it was within the confines of a closed ecosystem, a walled garden such as a single application, a single video game, a single world. To enforce scarcity you needed trust in the system, you needed their approval, and you could not step outside of it to take your items",
